# Dynamic Mapping Class

I have been wanting to create one of these for a while so I'm not relying on libraries and stuff. It might not be performant, literally no idea as I haven't checked. I might, eventually.

I have been using my own little mapper until now that only maps on exact property name matches. This one will do that by default but also allow you to specify other mappings and also provide an anonymous object alongside that to map several values into the output that don't exist in the input object.
